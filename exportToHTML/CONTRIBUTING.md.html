Team software is just that, your team's.  It's specific to the tasks you are trying to accomplish, the testing you are doing, and goals your team has.  You don't want that pushed into the official SDK.</span>

<a name="l25"><span class="ln">25   </span></a><span class="s2">The real intent for advanced users is often to issue a pull request from the </span><span class="s1">[</span><span class="s2">branch</span><span class="s1">](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/using-branches/git-branch) </span><span class="s2">on a local fork back to master on either the same local fork or a child of the team fork and not on the parent ftctechnh/ftc_app.  See </span><span class="s1">[</span><span class="s2">Creating a Pull Request</span><span class="s1">](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request-from-a-fork/)</span><span class="s2">.</span>
<a name="l26"><span class="ln">26   </span></a>
<a name="l27"><span class="ln">27   </span></a><span class="s2">If that is indeed the intent, then you can merge your </span><span class="s1">[</span><span class="s2">topic branch</span><span class="s1">](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Branching-Branching-Workflows#Topic-Branches) </span><span class="s2">into master locally by hand before pushing it up to github, or if you want a pull request for pulls between branches on the same repository because, say, you want team members to look at your software before merging into master, you can select the base fork from the dropdown on the </span><span class="s1">&quot;</span><span class="s2">Open a pull request</span><span class="s1">&quot; </span><span class="s2">page and select your team repo instead of ftctechnh's.</span>
<a name="l28"><span class="ln">28   </span></a>
<a name="l29"><span class="ln">29   </span></a><span class="s2">Alternatively, if you have a team repository forked from ftctechnh/ftc_app, and then team members individually fork from your team repository, then pull requests from the individual team member's forks will have the main team repository automatically selected as the base fork for the pull. And you won't inadvertently request to pull your team software into ftctechnh</span><span class="s1">'</span><span class="s2">s repository.</span>
<a name="l30"><span class="ln">30   </span></a>
<a name="l31"><span class="ln">31   </span></a><span class="s2">The latter would be the </span><span class="s1">&quot;</span><span class="s2">best</span><span class="s1">&quot; </span><span class="s2">way to manage software among a large team. But as with all things git there are many options.</span>

<a name="l33"><span class="ln">33   </span></a><span class="s2">Pull requests that do not fall into the category above are evaluated by the FTC Technology Team on a case-by-case basis.  Please note however that the deployment model of the SDK does not support direct pulls into ftctechnh/ftc_app.  </span>
